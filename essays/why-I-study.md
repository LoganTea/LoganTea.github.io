## Why I started

I started programming in high school because one of my friends wanted to take the class and I wanted to join him. The only computer science courses offered at my high school were AP level courses so it was also good to get the AP credits in. During the class I had with my friend I really started to love programming, so in my senior year I took the second AP computer science course my school offered, and I enjoyed that one even more. Mainly because the first one was java, which I am a known hater of. The second one I took was in python, which I had a lot more fun in. Because of these experiences, and the fact that computer science can make a lot of money, I decided to major in computer science. 

## How it's going

Overall in college the only problem I have with the major is that a lot of the requirements are awkward to get. I feel like the courses could have been put together a little better or maybe a little more detailed, and I also hate classes where I have to teach myself (At that point why am I paying for the class?) so I haven't had as much fun as I thought I would in this major, but hopefully my last two semesters change that. 

## Future plans

In the future I plan to go into the game design industry, preferably something to do with narrative design. I know it seems weird that I'm a computer science major and I want to go into narrative design, but that's because I plan to use computer science as my intro into the industry, and hopefully I'll get to make my own games eventuall. All of this is why I'm a B.A. in computer science instead of a B.S., because I plan to go into more artistic fields rather than scientific ones.
