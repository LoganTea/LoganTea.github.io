## What are *"Coding Standards"*?
Coding standards are essentially the way your program is organized. It's the indentation rules, making sure code isn't too nonsensical and ensuring parts of your code aren't redundant. These are mainly used when you're first learning how to code, from what I've been told, and that once you get into the workforce coding standards aren't usually as heavily enforced. Though, as someone who hasn't participated in the workforce I wouldn't know if that's true or not. What I do know is that I personally don't really care for coding standards, even if they're already baked into my head.

## My thoughts on coding standards
Overall I don't really like coding standards. I feel that a lot of them are unecessary, though I do understand teaching languages with them at first. While I wouldn't say that the existince of coding standards makes any language easier to learn, I do think that teaching languages with some form of coding standard is useful to ensure that when you get comfortable with the language you can form your own structure for whatever language it is. I also don't like coding standards because a lot of the time they don't let me write my silly goofy things in the comments. 

## How comfortable is ESLint?
Overall ESLint feels pretty simple as far as coding standards go, and since I've taken several programming classes that baked coding standards into my brain I really don't run into too many issues with ESLint. In addition, my professor doesn't care if I put silly goofy things in my comments as long as they still make sense. Because of that, ESLint isn't too hard to deal with in my opinion, and it's probably useful for people who aren't as familiar with coding standards.
