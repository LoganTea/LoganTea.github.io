## My initial thoughts

So far I really enjoy typescript/javascript (they seem pretty much the same to me). However, I also think they seem to be pretty similar to python. They do still feel a little more sophisticated than python, but overall I think I might like them more. I always felt that python was too simple almost, and it never really felt like I was making a proper set of code. However, I really tend to hate languages like Java or C++ because of the object-oriented nature of them. As a noted Java hater, I can confirm I like typescript a lot more than that, it's definitely a language I enjoy programming in. 

## "Athletic Software Engineering"

So far this class has been SUPER stressful for me. I think the large workload that was just dumped on us at the beginning (I know that in the end it wasn't actually that much work, but looking at the 100+ tutorials really set my academic paralysis off). The fact that each language's tutorial, since we had to do javascript and typescript, added up to such a large number of these small assignments made it really hard for me to get motivated. I really don't enjoy it, but I think that in the end it might help me understand the language better. I really just wish it was less stressful.

## WODs and Practice WODs

I decided to give the WODs a section of their own. WODs are a "Work out of the day" and they are almost like a timed coding test that causes me much stress and displeasure. We have the practices on Tuesdays, and then the real one on Thursdays. Overall, I hate the WODs. I know that they are meant to help us build our efficiency of coding but the timer really stresses me out. I mean, in today's WOD I was stressing so much over such tiny things that I couldn't see the issues as simple as "You accidentally deleted a curly brace". Then, after finishing I looked at the clock and I still had 6 of the 20 minutes to spare. This might be a me problem because of my bad anxiety, but I really don't enjoy the stress that the WODs put on me for no good reason. However, of course, I understand that the ability to code efficiently is very important, and that like vegetables the WODs are probably good for me even if I don't like them.
