## Introduction
To be completely honest, I didn't learn much in this course. The way this course was taught was not the way I learn best, since it was a lot of rushing and pressure. As they say, the same water that hardens the egg softens the potato. While I know a lot of other people in this course are the egg, I am the potato. Therefore, the topics I am covering are not really things I "learned" in this class but are rather the ways I've made minor alterations my understandings.

## Coding Standards 
Coding standards are very different from class to class. In short, coding standards are a set of rules your code has to follow based on formatting. While it usually has no impact on functionality, it can be important in how people understand your code. The coding standards in this class were a little harsh, and made me miss my high school python class where the teacher let us do whatever we wanted. However, I understand that in a professional setting coding standards are very necessary. This class helped me acclimate to harsher coding standards and taught me how to quickly adapt when I need to change how I write my code.

## User Interface Frameworks
User interface frameworks are like a stencil for a user interface. Similar to design patterns which are the next topic in this essay, they're a way to quickly create a user interface for a project. They allow you to use a template and add in your own info - similar to how the site you're reading this on was built - which takes out a lot of the hassle in making a user interface. Overall, as I covered in my other essay "Are Frameworks Lameworks" I believe that frameworks are vital to programming because it allows us to get by without reinventing the wheel. In this class I learned about these templates, though I wish we learned more about the templates themselves. I think that this class would've been a lot more fun if instead of the final project being what it was, the personal portfolio was the final project and we just learned how to put together our own websites like this.

## Design Patterns
Design patterns are also a sort of template in coding, but function more in the backend than in the user interface. They are used all the time for problems that already have solutions. In this class I definitely used my fair share of design patterns, and learned how to better find and make use of them. In this class we explored more into altering design patterns to fit our needs. I also have an essay more on this topic, "Design Patterns Align Matters" which talks about design patterns and gives more information on what they are and my opinion on them. Overall I think this class has set me up to better use design patterns in my future of programming. After all, better understanding how the design patterns actually work will help to use them in all sorts of new and useful ways.
