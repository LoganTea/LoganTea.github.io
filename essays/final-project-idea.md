## Overview
### The Problem
  The problem this final project is looking at is that a lot of students tend to struggle in the front half of courses when they don't understand the materials or content given to them. For example, in our very class of 314 a lot of us struggle with the Nextjs and Bootstrap applications because of a lack of knowledge and understanding, further enforced by the allowance of AI in our assignments. Because of this I don't think any of us actually know how to properly use those applications.
### The Solution
  We believe that the solution to this problem is to have a site where you can upload notes, explanations, and assistance for different things. This is often done inside of discord groups that are formed for the different classes, but this would mean that over the course of several semesters the answers to all of the minor issues would slowly be fixed, information would stockpile for new students to use, and it would overall make it much easier for students to learn and understand what they're doing in class.

## Proposers
  Xingyao He, Ellie Ishii, and Logan Teachout are the proposers for this final project and intend on being in the same group for the final project. This essay was written, and the topics designed, collaboratively between all three proposers in this group.

## Mockup Page Ideas
  Our ideas for the mockup page were to have a navbar to hop between the different parts of the website that could be used. This would only have access to the proper tabs of the website after logging in of course. We would have a course materials section where all of the different instances of people uploading notes, assistance, or other useful information could be found. This would be sortable by course, instructor, and/or the type of resource that the instance is.
  We would also plan on having a page dedicated to selling or giving away used textbooks to other students taking the same course. These could be sorted by subject, condition, and price. Users would also be allowed to comment on posts to ask questions
  A bookmark page would be a good addition to be able to mark certain resources as important or to mark several different versions of the same textbook you might be looking at. This would allow users more comfort and ease of use.
  Finally, an upload page that would be used to upload textbook listings and class resources or information. This would allow it to be more streamlined in function, since the upload section wouldn't have to be part of the browsing pages.

## Use Case Ideas
  The use cases for this site is firstly of course getting and publishing resources for the classes that either you are taking or that you need to take. It's useful for students who are having issues with different things within the class. In example, if you were havings issues installing or using an application for a class. You could then use this site to find resources to help you with what you're struggling with.
  In addition, you could use this website to assist other students with finding the textbooks they need for a cheaper price. This would both allow users to get access to cheaper textbooks and allow users to get money back for $300 textbooks they aren't using anymore.

## Beyond the Basics
  As far as the special things go, we determined that it would be an interesting addition to make it that you could only see content after providing something to the site yourself. This could be a used textbook or a set of notes for a class, but it would allow as a sort of tutorial for posting book listings and/or notes and other resources. I believe this would be a good thing to have as the "special" thing for each individual user.
