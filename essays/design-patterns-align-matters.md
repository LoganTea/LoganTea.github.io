## The Stencil of the Comp Sci World
Design patterns are essentially an example of how to make something happen with your code. That's the short and sweet answer. In that way, they're similar to a stencil that an artist might use. An artist can use a stencil in a myriad of ways, even though the stencil itself never changes. This relates to design patterns because they don't necessarily do the same thing in every code. Just as an artist would use a stencil and put it anywhere, for any purpose, and with any color, a programmer can do the same with a design pattern. Putting it anywhere in the code where it can be helpful, adding their own personal edits, and all around using the pattern to assist them with the full program, but not using it to make the whole thing.

## In That Case, Call Me an Artist
I use design patterns pretty much any chance I get. I love to solve coding problems on my own, and when I work on personal projects or passion projects I will usually refrain from using design patterns or use design patterns that I myself made. However, especially during classes or busy points in life I can't exactly spend 20-30 minutes solving an issue when google has a pattern for you to use. I'm all for reinventing the wheel when I have the time, but sometimes you just don't have the time to stick a rock on an axle.

## Design Patterns Program Faster
In conclusion, I personally really appreciate and do tend to utilize a lot of design patterns when coding on a time limit. Overall, I think that these patterns are also really good for teaching newer programmers who don't have as good of a grasp on troubleshooting and debugging. Like the classic "Hello World" example. You tell a group of people who are new to programming exactly how to write it out, but still they can add their own styles or personal quirks. Like how some people make a curly brace that goes right next to the beginning "This{" while others might put a space "This {". This helps new programmers develop skill while also developing their own techniques. That's why in my opinion, design patterns matter.
