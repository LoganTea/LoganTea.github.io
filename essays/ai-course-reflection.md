## Introduction
In modern education I feel that AI could be used in very helpful ways, however it's currently become a sort of cheating mechanic. Especially in the field of software engineering where people will just plug any issues into an AI to get what they need. However, AI has been very helpful for teachers too because it can help with grading assistance, but I don't know how frequently that's actually used. Overall, AI is currently more harmful to education than helpful in my opinion, but hopefully that can change eventually. I only used ChatGPT, and only very little. 

## Personal Experience With AI
#### Experience WODs
I didn't use AI for the experience WODs simply because I wanted to do it myself. For most of the class I was very much against the use of AI because I didn't pay thousands for a course to go "Ok just make AI do it". I wanted to actually learn how to do things and how things functioned. However, the problem is that with how this class is taught it almost makes AI a requirement, and I wish I could go back and actually use AI, because now instead I'm leaving this class with basic knowledge of Typescript and HTML because that's all we were actually taught.
#### In-Class Practice WODs
Simply to not be repetitive, because I doubt whoever is grading this wants to read the same paragraph over and over, I didn't use AI here for the same reason as the experience WODs. I wanted to learn how to do it myself and figure my way around the tools personally.
#### In-Class WODs
I didn't use AI here not only because I didn't want to, but because I felt that I would probably be able to code something better with personal knowledge rather than trying to figure out how to explain exactly what I need to say to an AI. However some of the WODs felt like the time was impossible to meet without using AI assistance. 
#### Essays
I actually had a lot of fun writing the essays myself. When the professor said "It's more like an informal blog" I was like "Oh ok I'm gonna just say my thoughts then". I also was able to make funny title names and it was very soothing to get to rant about how upset I was over how the class was structured. 
#### Final Project
I pretty much had AI do the final project for me. Not by choice, mind you. If I was actually taught how to use any of the tools that were required I would've loved to actually program it myself. I'm not here because ICS has good job prospects, I'm here because I love coding. However, the final project being "Code a functioning website" when we're only taught anything at a very base introductory level in this class was a little unreasonable. I would send ChatGPT a picture of a mockup, then ask to add bit by bit. Like "Can you separate it so that there can be code on the left and right side" and then "Can you make it so they load seperately" and "Can you make it so it pulls from the database".
#### Learning a Concept
I honestly think this is the best way to use ChatGPT, and practically a requirement for this class. It's very thorough in it's explanations, and even though I didn't use it in this way it was sort of trying to explain things to me while I asked it to help with my final project. It's fairly useful as a teacher, especially with coding examples. 
#### Answering a Question
I never really used AI like this because most of my questions were specifically about the class, and I don't think ChatGPT would have the answer to that.
#### Asking or Answering a Smart Question
I don't understand how this is different from the previous one. I feel like if I didn't use AI to answer questions why would it be any different because you put the question in a tophat. 
#### Coding Example
Again this ties into the learning a concept section. It's very useful for getting examples and learning how pieces of code fit together.
#### Explaining Code
I don't understand how this is any different from the previous section. Yes, it can explain code, no I sadly didn't use it in this way even though it would have been very helpful.
#### Writing Code
This is the part I ended up using it for. It's very adept at giving you what you need and making it in such a way that it can be plugged into your programs and used to finish up projects. This part is better explained in the final project section
#### Documenting Code
I'm not actually sure what this section means by "Documenting Code". However, I can assure you I didn't use AI for it, and probably because it was either fun or because I didn't want to and I'm stubborn.
#### Quality Assurance
I did a lot of quality assurance during the final project, I would give it my code and ask why it's giving me x error at line y, and it would go through and explain why the error was there and how I could fix it. It was very helpful and overall might have actually taught me how to debug a little better.
#### Other Uses Not Listed
I used ChatGPT to complain about things that I had issues with and it was very useful as a therapist of sorts. I believe this is another vital use of ChatGPT as an AI companion in this class because I think my friends got tired of me complaining eventually.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
For this class specifically I think that ChatGPT has been very helpful as an assistant to my learning and understanding, but I don't think that's something that goes for every class. I did have some parts of the class I wouldn't have enjoyed if I just used AI for everything, so I don't think it can be reliably good for education. However, in this scenario it was very helpful.

## Practical Applications
I think that AI is very useful in the way one of the sites I use to code for fun, replit, implimented it. It was more just there for repetitive sections or remembering variables. It was very useful for not having an issue where you forget a single semicolon or don't remember exactly how a variable is spelled. I think that is the best way for AI to be used in software engineering. This is because if the AI makes the program entirely on it's own then we won't be able to properly understand how every individual part works if we need to adjust or fix things. In addition, if there's some major flaw we wouldn't be able to catch it as readily because of the reputation AI is getting. 

## Challenges and Oppurtunities
My only challenge with AI in this course was the battle I had for the first 90% of the semester where I refused to use AI for everything so I could try and learn everything myself. However, I do think that AI can be a helpful integration in the way I mentioned in the previous section where it was used to make repetitive code less repetitive. However, I also think it could be helpful as a minor assistant in earlier ICS classes where there's a lot of students who don't know much about coding and need help with small bits and pieces. I think having a tool like this would be a great assistant to instructors. 

## Comparitive Analysis
I think that comparitively, AI integrated learning versus traditional learning isn't properly set up in our society yet. I think we still have to learn how to make AI more of a teacher assistant rather than a student assistant. I believe that if every student that has an issue just uses ChatGPT it would cause them to have a less stable understanding of topics. However, if instead the AI just explained things and helped them to come to the conclusion themself it might be a very useful tool that would help make student's understanding more stable than traditional teaching. 

## Future Considerations
To culminate my opinions of the future of AI in education, I believe it could be a helpful tool with a little more effort. Using AI to essentially make personal TAs would be extremely helpful, but I can also see where that could be challenging to impliment. I think that it would be mostly advantageous as long as people don't start trying to replace teachers with AI. However, I think this is something still far in the future, and that for now AI is a little too giving to be a proper teaching assistant unless used by a student who actively wants to learn.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, AI is a good tool to use here and there, but overall I feel that too much reliance currently is causing problems with people not understanding what they need to be doing. However, I think it has a lot of advantages too in classes where there is too many students for the teacher to properly assist every individual student. It can also be advantageous for students who get too much anxiety to actually ask their teachers questions. I think this class specifically would have been a lot better if instead of that "This class is really hard" speech at the beginning it was explained that "We only teach intro level techniques, and so you should use AI and other resources to foster a better understanding of the material".
