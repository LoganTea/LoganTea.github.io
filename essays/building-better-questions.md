## What is a *"Smart Question"*?
In short, a *"Smart Question"* is essentially just taking a breath and asking a question in a way that can properly be answered. Instead of being vague and just saying something isn't working, or that you're having an issue with something, you give information that can be used to help. So instead of just saying "My print function isn't working" you could explain "I'm using python and when I write (Insert code here) I'm not getting (Outcome you desire)."By writing your questions in a way that gives more detail and evidence it's easier for people to understand what you want and how to help you.

In addition, a "Smart Question" is a question asked after trying to do your own research and finding the answer on the internet. Chances are with most issues that someone else has already had the same problem, and you might even be able to find exactly what you need. However, you can also try to make sure you aren't asking a question that has something similar answered. It's like how if you need to add 5 apples with 2 oranges, you can get a similar answer from knowing 5 grapes and 2 coconuts. So, make sure you try to find the answer before asking the question, otherwise people might be less than cordial with answering you.

## Example of a *Smart* Question
A good example I found of a smart question on stack overflow is worded as "How do I make a flat list out of a list of lists?" [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/952914/how-do-i-make-a-flat-list-out-of-a-list-of-lists). This question gets to the point, gives what they want and shows what they mean. In addition the question is tagged with the language, "Python", so you know what language they need the answer to be in. The question seems simple, but at the same time I feel like the specifics can be hard to find online because usually terminology like that will just bring up a bunch of list tutorials. 

## Example of a *Not Smart* Question
A good example of a not smart question I found would be "Home-Assistant app is extremely slow on initial loading" [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78980942/home-assistant-app-is-extremely-slow-on-initial-loading). This question instead is more of a complaint than a question. They show an image of something that comes up, but they don't really explain anything. In addition, they don't give any information on what might be causing their issue, they just say what's happening and expecting people to be able to help.

## Why We Need Smart Questions
Smart questions are very important in software engineering for many reasons. The main reason being, we rely on each other a lot. The questions we ask now could help future generations of software engineers to not only better their own questions, but to help solve their issues too. Because of this, we need to make sure we're asking smart questions so that as a community we can better ourselves and each other.
