## My thoughts on frameworks
Overall I find the use of frameworks very interesting. They seem to help making things appear more professional easier. In addition, it feels very easy to implement at least with bootstrap 5. Bootstrap 5 is the one we've been using in class, and it usually only takes 3 lines of code to implement. Overall, the main issue I have with it is that sometimes it's a little confusing and time consuming with how long the class names are. It's usually like 'Navbar-background-img-dark' or something similar. Because of that, I can see where there is some sort of discomfort in adopting it but overall I like it.

## My experience in this class
My real issue with framework is that this class isn't the best learning environment. I don't really know how or why things fit together, and because of that I get really annoyed with things. I feel like this class is built to force us into using AI, since there are things on the assignments that we haven't learned yet. However, I refuse to use AI in the assignments because I want to learn to code. I'm in this major because I want to learn how to program. Instead I'm learning the pieces, but not being told how or why they work, and then being expected to build something completely new out of it.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I think frameworks are actually pretty useful and easy to implement, however I cannot really comment on the ease of usage since I'm not entirely sure how to put all the pieces together in the ways I want to move them. it would be like knowing that a for loop can iterate through a list, but only ever iterating through lists. You never actually learned that you could iterate a set number of times, you only learned how to iterate lists. Then you're asked to iterate something 5 times. You would immediately be confused and need to find some roundabout way to solve the problem. Which is why I'm not really a fan of this class, but I need the credit to graduate so here I am.
