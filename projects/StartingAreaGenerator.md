summary: "This starting area generator was a passion project I made to generate generic places for dungeons and dragons games I would run."
---

This generator will help generate an entire reigon for a dungeons and dragons location. I had a lot of fun making it as a passion project in my freshman year of college. It has everything you would need to know from the type of government, to the environment, and even the people that live there. It still leaves bits and pieces vague so that you can fill in some blanks, but overall it's a big help in creating worlds for D&D games. Also, I hid some things here and there just for fun as little easter eggs.
