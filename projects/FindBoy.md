summary: "Find Boy! is another game I made in high school, but this one was much closer to the end of the year."
---

"Find Boy!" is a much more complicated game where you have 3 rounds to find 3 different turtles on a camo-pattern background. It has a red button to give up if you can't find all three turtles, and when you finish the three rounds it gives you your score out of 9 points.
