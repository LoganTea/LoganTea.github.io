summary: "Textswap is a website I developed with Dhaniel Bolosan, Ellie Ishii, and Xingyao He for buying and selling used textbooks."

Textswap is a website where you can list or buy textbooks from other students so that you can save some money on a book that's required but also costs $200. Our original idea was much more ambitious, but when we actually started on the program we realized that we should simplify our goals down, and in the end our website turned out great. You can find our homepage here: https://textswap.github.io/Textswap/ and our repository can be found here: https://github.com/Textswap/Textswap.

I did a lot of the work on the index.md file and the account page, but also did all of the class presentations because I slightly enjoy public speaking. Overall this project didn't really teach me much of anything because we didn't really learn anything. The only thing we learned is that sometimes stress and pressure leads to innovation.
