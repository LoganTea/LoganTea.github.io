summary: "Catch Boy! is a game that I programmed in my senior year of high school in an AP computer science class using python."
---

"Catch Boy" is a very simple game where you click on a turtle as it runs around the screen. I had implemented a "timed" and "Endless" mode. In the timed mode you would see how many times you could catch the boy in a set amount of time, and in the endless mode you could just zone out and click the turtle over and over.

I do not have a github repo for this project, and since it's very small I don't have much to say about it. I completed the entire project on my own and learned how to better use the python turtle graphics feature, even though I only ended up using it for one other project.
